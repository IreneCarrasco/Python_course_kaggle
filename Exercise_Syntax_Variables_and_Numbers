# This is a silly question intended as an introduction to the format we use for hands-on exercises throughout all Kaggle courses.
# *What is your favorite color? *
# create a variable called color with an appropriate value on the line below
# (Remember, strings in Python must be enclosed in 'single' or "double" quotes)
color='blue'


# Complete the code below. In case it's helpful, here is the table of available arithmetic operations:
pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter/2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi*radius**2

# Add code to the following cell to swap variables a and b (so that a refers to the object previously referred to by b and vice versa).

# If you're curious, these are examples of lists. We'll talk about 
# them in depth a few lessons from now. For now, just know that they're
# yet another type of Python object, like int or float.

b = [3, 2, 1]

# Your code goes here. Swap the values to which a and b refer.

# Alice, Bob and Carol have agreed to pool their Halloween candy and split it evenly among themselves. 
# For the sake of their friendship, any candies left over will be smashed. 
# For example, if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.
# Write an arithmetic expression below to calculate how many candies they must smash for a given haul.
# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109

# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies
total_candies = alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies
sorted_candies = total_candies//3
to_smash = total_candies - sorted_candies*3
